# SecHex-API-CONFUSION
Confuse your haters!

# What it does? 🏆
It decrypt the encrypted AES-Key with the encrypted Base64-Key that is also encrypted in a another file. 

# Example ✨   
```name: SecHex.私は熟女が大好きです("2TUWNWhIugdj+aDdJQ2Aww==", 我們也討厭那些想要分析我們代碼的愚蠢的狗娘養的她的陰戶.我們喜歡狩獵毛茸茸的動物)```                                      
2TUWNWhIugdj+aDdJQ2Aww== -> Decrypt with Base64 eTJWM2RHbDFaV3hnUTJ4eQ== = y2V3dGl1ZWxgQ2xy -> 2TUWNWhIugdj+aDdJQ2Aww== + y2V3dGl1ZWxgQ2xy = U2VjSGV4 = SecHex                                      


# How to Secure?

After this, use multiply obfuscator. Your API key is now more difficult to comprehend,
although not entirely secure. Alternatively, you can employ a server and establish a system that retrieves the encrypted API keys from the server.

Cheers!
